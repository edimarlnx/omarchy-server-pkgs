# Router replacement for install/hardware/network.sh and, versus the server
# profile, for install/server/network-server.sh.
#
# A router has at least two NICs with fixed roles: WAN faces the uplink and
# takes a DHCP lease; LAN faces the internal network, holds the gateway address
# and hands out leases. systemd-networkd and systemd-resolved do all of this
# with no networking package added -- the same reason the server profile uses
# them.
#
# Roles, not renamed interfaces. This host's NICs keep their kernel names
# (enp1s0/eth0/...); the WAN and LAN are ROLES assigned to them, the way
# OPNsense assigns a role to a physical port. The mapping lives in
# /etc/omarchy/router/roles.conf, both forms editable and reassignable:
#
#   WAN_IF=/LAN_IF=    by interface name
#   WAN_MAC=/LAN_MAC=  by MAC, matched to the interface that carries it now
#
# An autoinstall drive may carry a `router-nics` file with the same lines;
# omarchy-cidata-load copies it to /root and this script seeds roles.conf from
# it. Until BOTH roles are assigned nothing is forwarded and every interface
# takes a DHCP lease, so the machine is a plain reachable SSH host -- a safe
# unconfigured state, not an open one and not a locked-out one.
